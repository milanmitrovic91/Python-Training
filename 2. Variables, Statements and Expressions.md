## Plan for today

  - Variable assignment
  - Variable types
  - Variable names
  - Expressions and Statements
  - Order of operations

  - Script mode VS Interactive mode
  - Computer memory
  - Comments
  - Debugging (3 types of errors)


## Variables as boxes

  - Variable is nothing but the name of box in which some data (int, string, list, dictionary...) is stored.
  
  

## Variable assignment

  - Computers can do only 3 things:
    - Perform calculation
    - Remember what was calculated
    - Decide when to stop
  - Repeat previous 3 steps many times
  - Today we focus on second part


## Variable assignment

  - Remember what was calculated = Store results
  - In order to store results, following should be defined:
    - What should be stored
    - Where should be stored

  - Why should we deal with data storage and variable assignment?

## Computer memory model

  - Think about computer memory as a grid. 
  - When you input some value, it is stored at some place in grid.
  - It has internally generated number (reference) which says on which part of grid data is stored.
  - Internally generated number is awkward, large, complex. It is difficult to remember it.
  - So, instead, we use variable to reference value stored in memory.


## Variable as box

  - Think about variable as box in which we store value.

  - Box is place in memory which is occupied by data.

  - Name of box is variable’s name.


## Valid name for variable

  - Letters, numbers and underscore are legal

  - Name can’t start with number

  - Same name for variable and function is not possible


  - Can’t use keyword as name for function

  - If you want your variable name to be same as reserved keyword, just add trailing underscore.
    - e.g. from_, import_, global_

## Python reserved keywords

  - How to find list of all keywords in python?
    - help(‘keywords’)

## Variables

  - Simple variables
    - Int, float, boolean, None

  - Compound variables
    - String, list, tuple, set, dictionary, frozenset



  - Two types of variables in python:
    - Mutable
    - Immutable

## Types of variables

  - Immutable
    - Integer
    - Floats
    - Boolean
    - (None)
    - Strings
    - Frozen set
    
  - Mutable
    - List
    - Tuples
    - Set
    - Dictionary
    
 
## What can we do with variables?


  - Python operators:

    - Arithmetic
    - Assignment
    - Comparison
    - Logical


    - Membership
    - Bitwise
    - Identity


## Arithmetic operators
