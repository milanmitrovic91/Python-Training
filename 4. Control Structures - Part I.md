# Controle structures - Part I


## What is program?

  - Procedure

  - Sequence of steps that should be performed.

  - Well designed program consists of smaller independent parts.

  - These independent parts should be executed in some order.


## What is control structure?

  - Control structure defines in which order program is going to be executed.

  - First do this, then do this, after do thatâ€¦

  - If some condition is met, do this. Otherwise do that.


## Controle structure types

  - Sequence logic, or sequential flow

  - Selection logic, or conditional flow

  - Iteration logic, or repetitive flow




## How is program executed?

  - Top to bottom


## Sequence logic - Sequence flow


## Selection logic - Conditional flow

  - If statement

  - If-else statement

  - Switch - does not exist in python. Can be replicated by else-if statement.


## Iteration logic - Repetitive flow

  - For loop

  - While loop

  - Do loop - does not exist in python. Can be made using for or while statement.


## Controle structure

  - Every control structure consists of two parts:
    - Head
    - Body
  - How are head and body separated?
  - Can there be more than one head/body?


  - Head and body are separated by colon and indentation.

  - There can be more than one head/body.If-else statement.


  - Head
    - Contains sth that evaluates to boolean
  - Body
    - Contains set of instructions that should be performed if head evaluates to true



## Break, continue, pass
