# Python collections


## Containers

  - This lecture could also be named containers.

  - Because containers are used to store things.


## Programming - Big picture

  - Programming is all about:
    - Storing data
    - Processing data
    - Storing processed data

## Python collections

  - List
  - Dictionary
  - Tuple

  - String
  - Set
  - Frozenset


## Collections hack :)

  - Order matters everywhere except in dictionaries.

  - “Dictionaries are order agnostic.”



## Mutable/immutable

  - Two types (dimensions) of mutability:
    - Can we add/delete elements from collection (box)
    - Can we change/update existing elements from collection (box)



  - Mutable objects
    - List
    - Dictionary
    - Set
    - Bytearray

  - Immutable objects

    - Integer
    - Float
    - String
    - Tuple
    - Frozen set
    - Complex
    - Bytes

## 1. Lists

  - What can we do with list?

  - What concepts are related to list? In which way?


  - Computer can do only 3 things:
    - Perform some calculation
    - Remember what is calculated
    - Repeat process large number of time

  - List is collection of elements.

  - Those elements can be of different type.

## Lists intro

  - List indexing
    - We can access elements of list by using corresponding indices.

  - Index starts from 0 !!!


  - List slicing
    - We can get several elements of list using slicing operator.
   
  - Two rules:
    - Including first
    - Excluding last.


## Lists intro - list methods

  - .copy
  - .count
  - .append
  - .index
  - .extend
  - .clear
  - .insert
  - .pop
  - .remove
  - .reverse
  - .sort
  - ._ _len_ _



## List is a sequence

  - List is just box which stores sequence of elements.

  - Each element has its own unique index.


## Lists are mutable



## Traversing a list

  - It is done using loops.

  - Nested lists count as single element.

  - Skip for now.

## List operations

  - “+” operator concatenates two lists.

  - “ * ” operator repeats a list given number of times.


## List slices


  - my_list [x:y] - all elements from Xth (including) up to but not including Yth element.
  - If you omit first element, it starts from beginning and goes up to Y-th element
  - If you omit last element, it starts from X-th element (including) and goes towards end.

## List methods

  - Append
  - Extend
  - Sort
  - …

## Map, filter, reduce

  - Very important concepts!

  - Skip for now. When we learn loops, we will come back.

## Deleting elements


  - .pop
    - Delete and return n-th element in list
    - If n is not specified, then removes last element in list
  - .remove
    - If you know element, but not its index
    - Deletes first element it sees
  - del 

## List and strings



## Objects and values

  - Equivalent: two objects have same values
  - Identical: if two objects are same i.e. two variables are pointing to same object.

  - Objects are used for storing values.
  - Objects can be equivalent, but not identical.
  - Every identical object is also equivalent.



## Aliasing (nickname)

  - Association of variable with object is called reference.
  - An object with mor ethan one reference has more than one name. This object is aliased.
  - If aliased object is mutable, changes made with obe object affect other object.


  - Aliasing is useful, but it is error prone.
  - When working with mutable objects, it is best to avoid aliasing at all.


  - Rule of thumb: 
    - If you have return value, then modification is not performed in place.
    - If you have return value, then modification is done of ‘pass by value’ type.

## Glossary

  - List
  - Element (aka item)
  - Nested list
  - Accumulator (variable i)


  - Augmented assignment
  - Reduce
  - Map
  - Filter

  - Object
  - Equivalent
  - Identical



  - Reference
  - Aliasing



## 2. Dictionaries


  - Collection of key-value pairs.

  - Key must be unique, value does not have to be.

  - Unordered collection of key-value pairs (aka items).

  - List has index, dictionary has keys !!!




  - Dictionary methods:
    - .copy (shallow copy)
    - .clear
    - .items
    - .keys
    - .values
    - .pop
    - .popitem
    - .update
    - ._ _len_ _


## A dictionary is a mapping

  - key:value pairs


## Looping and dictionaries


## Dictionaries VS lists


## Glossary

  - Mapping
  - Dictionary
  - Key-value pairs
  - Item
  - Key

  - Value
  - Implementation
  - Hashtable
  - Hash function
  - Hashtable


## 3. Tuples


  - Immutable data type

  - Collection of elements

  - Tuple methods:
    - .index - returns index of first occurrence of value
    - .count - count how many particular elements exist in list


  - Tuple operations:
    - Slicing
    - Multiplication
    - Relational operators (performed on element by element basis)


  - Tuple creation:
    - A = 1,2,3,4
    - A = (1,2,3,4)


  - Typical usage:
    - Multiple return values in function !!!



## Iterators


  - Iterators are collections similar to lists.
  - You can iterate through.
  - But, you can’t use index to access elements of iterator.


## Zip and Enumerate

  - Special and very useful functions.


## Glossary


  - Tuple
  - Tuple assignment
  - Zip object
  - Iterator
  - Data structure


## 4. Strings


  - String methods:
    - .count
    - .index
    - .format
    - .capitalize
    - .casefold
    - .endswith
    - .expandtabs
    - .find
    - .join
    - .lower
    - .partition
    - .replace
    - .startswith
    - .strip

 ## A string is a sequence
 
 ## Traversal with a for loop
 
 ## String slices
 
 ## Strings are immutable
 
 ## “in” operator
 
 ## String comparison


## Glossary

  - Object
  - Sequence
  - Item
  - Index
  - Slice
  - Empty string
  - Immutable



## 5. Sets

  - Mutable object i.e. can be changed.

  - Data structure (collection) that can contains unique/distinct elements.


## Set methods

  - .add
  - .clear
  - .copy
  - .difference
  - .intersection
  - …

## 6. Frozenset

  - Immutable object i.e. cannot be changed.

  - Can contain only unique/distinct elements.

## Frozenset methods


  - .copy
  - .difference
  - .intersection
  - .isdisjoint

  - .issubset
  - .issuperset
  - .symmetric_difference
  - .union
