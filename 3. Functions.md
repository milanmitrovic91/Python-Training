# Functions

## Learning plan

  - What is function?
  - Why do we need/use them?
  - What are function elements?
  - Input/output of a function?
  - Does function alternative exist?
  - Defining function VS calling function !!!
  - 
  - What types of functions exist?
  - Does function alternative exist?
  - What are function parameters?
  - What types of parameters exist?
  - What is function scope?



## Good definition

  - Function is block of code that is organised and grouped together in a way so that it can perform specific task.


  - Dividing your code into functions is going to make your code reusable, easier to read and maintain.

## Types of functions

  - Built-in

  - User defined


## Packages


  - Think about it as folders of files.

  - Main purpose is to help better organise files within python project.

  - Alternative would be to have all functions/classes in one file, which would be difficult to change, modify or even find.

  - Module is another name for python file i.e. file with extension '.py'.


## Import statement

  - Different ways to import functions/classes
    - import module_name
    - import module_name as some_alias
    - from module_name import function_name/class_name
    - from module_name import *


## Function paradigme


  - A factory that takes inputs and produces outputs.
    - Inputs: arguments
    - Output: return value
  - How many values can be returned?


## Why functions?

  - Easier to read and debug code

  - Can make code smaller by eliminating repetitive parts of code.
    - Rule: Write function for every part of code that you use on more than 2 places.


## Function composition


  - Using output of one function as input to other function.

  - Extremely useful in functional style of programming.


## Two part of function


  - Head
    - Name of function
    - Arguments
  - Body
    - What should be done?
    - What operations should be performed?
  - Body-header delimiter ‘:’


## Elements of function

  - Function name

  - Function arguments

  - Sequence of steps that should be accomplished (function body)

  - Return value


## Function arguments

  - Default value of arguments

  - *args

  - *kwargs



## Function workflow


  - Defining function - Declaring what should be done

  - Calling function - Performing actions

  - Statements defined inside function are not performed until function is called!



## Variable scope

  - Why should we care at all?
    - Passing arguments to function - meaning???
    - We can make/commit side effects i.e. we can non-intensionally modify values stored in variables.
    - We can non-intensionally change value of global variable.


## Passing variables (as arguments) to functions !!!


  - Very simple concept on first hand, but with potential to make really big mess (if not understood correctly and completely.)



## Pass by value/reference

  - This is separate topic. We are gonna study it in future. Today, we just want to scratch the surface!

  - a=77; b=a;
  - L = [1,2,3]; s = L;

  - When we say that sth is equal to sth i.e. when we assign value of sth to sth else, what happens under the hood? What we are actually doing? 

## Pass by value/reference

  - We can do one of two things:
    - We can copy element(s) from one box and put this copy to another box, or
    - We can put sth special into newly created box. This special element would be address of element that we want to copy.


## Variable scope

- Local scope
- Enclosing scope
- Global scope
- Built-in scope


## Variable scope - short intro


  - Function parameters are passed by object reference.

  - Inside function body we can access value of any global variables.



  - Variables declared inside function body are local
    - What does it mean local?

  - We can use global keyword to alter default behaviour


  - Global scope VS Local scope

  - Can you declare global variable from within local scope?



  - Can you access global variables from local scope? And vice verse?

    - You can access global variables from local scope.
    - You can’t access local variables from global scope.


  - Can you change global variable from local scope?

  - In other words, can operations performed in local scope affect variables in global scope?


## Mutable VS Immutable


  - It depends on type of variable (object).

  - Global mutable objects can be changed from local scope, while immutable global objects can’t be changed from local scope.


  - How we can check if object is mutable or not?

  - If we can change/modify value stored in box, object is mutable. 
  - How can we change/modify it?
    - Add/append elements, change value of existing elements etc.


  - Mutable-immutable check???
  - Object is mutable if at least one condition is true:
    - We can add/append elements to box or
    - We can modify existing elements from box.
  - After object modification, id() of object has not been changed!!!

  - Also, there are some methods/functions that change mutable object that is passed, while other methods/functions do not change object passed as parameter. It depends on how method is defined.

  - When we call some method, and get sth returned, then original object should NOT be unchanged. (It is general rule, should not be true in 100% of cases.)


## Variable scope - Best practice

  - It is bad practice to use global variables in function body.

  - Why? -> If we change mutable object inside function (within local scope), changes will be reflected in global scope, also.

  - (Global immutable objects we can’t even change inside function body. We can only access it.)


## Mutable/Immutable

  - Mutable objects:
    - List
    - Dictionary
    - Set
    - Bytearray

  - Immutable objects:
    - Integer
    - Float
    - String
    - Tuple
    - Frozen set
    - Complex
    - Bytes


  - Immutable objects are accessible in a quicker way than mutable objects.

  - Changing immutable objects is fundamentally expensive as it involves creating a copy; but changing mutable objects is considered cheap. 
(We see that ‘changing immutable object’ is actually incorrect name, because it is not being changed. Just copied and copy being changed.)


## Pay attention !!!

  - If you access value of global mutable variable inside function body and change it -> changes will be saved to global variables.

  - If you want to access value of global mutable variable inside function body, change it, but do not want to affect state of global variable -> use copy library. (from copy import copy, deep copy)


## Pass by value 

For now skip. We will deal it in future separate lecture.

Just be aware that sth like that exist.


## Pass by reference


  - For now skip. We will deal it in future separate lecture.

  - Just be aware that sth like that exist.


## Pass by object reference

  - This is a way Python is designed.

  - Variables are always passed by object reference.
    - First, interpreter try to change ‘original object.’ 
    - Second, if it is mutable, change is done. If it is not mutable, then it is copied and copy is changed.


## What we learned today


  - What is function?
  - Why do we need/use them?
  - What are function elements?
  - Input/output of a function?
  - Does function alternative exist?
  - Defining function VS calling function !!!

  - 

  - What types of functions exist?
  - Does function alternative exist?
  - What are function parameters?
  - What types of parameters exist?
  - What is function scope?


## Exercise tips

  - How to answer questions?
    - Paraphrase question. Explain it in simple words.
    - Identify input, desired output.
    - Think what elements you can use to solve question i.e. to transform inputs into outputs.
    - Combine (encapsulate) elements into reusable unit.



## The end

  - Thank you for your most valuable resource. Your time.
