## About myself

### I have graduated at Faculty of Economics, University of Belgrade (2010-2015)

### After graduation I started to code

- 2016-2018 mainly focused on Mathematica and Wolfram language

- In 2018 I started to code in python

### Work experience

- eFrond - Financial analyst 

  - Main tool was Excel

- GroundLink - Data Scientist

  - Automation of web data collection

  - Collection and analysis of competitors prices

  - Main tools were Python and Selenium

- NCR - Big Data Developer

## My teaching experience

### Selenium web-scraping introductory course held in late 2019 in GroundLink ( 5 colleagues attended training )

### Individual teaching - helping friends get start with python

## Course background

### How everything started?

### How we ended up participating in this course?

## About course

### This is course for absolute beginners

### No prior knowledge is assumed

### Pace is going to be easy and slow

## Elements of programming

- Introduction to course

- IDE vs Command line

- Different levels of abstractions

- What is abstraction?

- Programming VS coding

- American VS Japanese philosophy

- Built-in functions

- User defined functions

- Collections (list, dictionary, tuple, set)

- Iteration over collection

- For VS while loop

- Exceptions

- Pandas DataFrame()

- Map, Apply, vectorised operations

- Nested collections, nested loops

- Variable scope: global VS local variables

- Mutability

- Classes and Objects

- Abstraction VS implementation

- Procedures

- Types of variables: basic(simple) VS compound(complex)

- Different ways to execute python program

- Programming VS programming language

## Course structure

1. Variables, expressions, statements

2. Functions (builtin and user defined)

3. Control structures - Part I

4. Collections (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)

5. Control structures - Part II

6. Functional programming

7. Exceptions

8. Mutability of objects

9. Classes and objects

## Introduction

### 3 family of questions:

1. What are we going to learn? What is the topic? What question do we try to answer?

2. Why is it important? How can it help me? Why do I care? How can I benefit from it? What are its alternatives?

3. How to use it? How to implement it? What are different ways to apply it?

### If someone ask you what is programming, but give you only 10 seconds to answer…

#### Everything is about data

1. Getting data

2. Transforming data

3. Storing data


### Where does name ‘Information technology’ comes from?

### There is relationship: Data -> Information -> Knowledge

- Data - just any number, string or sequence of it

- Information - we know what data means

- Knowledge - we know how to use that information, how to take advantage and why it is important for us

## How computers work

### Computers can do ONLY 3 things:

- Perform calculation

- Remember result

- Decide weather to continue or stop execution

## How humans work

### Feynman technique:

1. Pick and study a topic

2. Explain the topic to someone, like a child, who is unfamiliar to the topic

3. Identify any gaps in your understanding

4. Review and simplify


## Structured approach

### What is structured approach?

### You have clear understanding of:

- Things you want to achieve

- Sequence of steps you need to perform and 

- You can, in simple words, explain your goal and way to achieve it


## Why structured approach?

### Main source of mistake in computer science:

- Things you want to achieve are not understood (you do not know to explain it in simple words)

- Assumptions

- Miscommunication


## Learning strategy

### Looking at things as elements of a whole

- What are important elements?

- What is relationship/hierarchy between elements?

### Take difficult topic and split it apart into sequence of simple steps

### Acceptable number of steps in a sequence

### What does acceptable in this case mean?

- 3-5 cause-effect relationships

### Top to bottom approach

- Start high level

- Go down into implementation details

### Bottom up approach

- Start from (boring) implementation details

- Then, eventually, go to ‘why’ question


## Top down approach
