## My teaching experience

### Selenium web-scraping introductory course held in late 2019 in GroundLink ( 5 colleagues attended training )

### Individual teaching - helping friends get start with python

## Course background

### How everything started?

### How we ended up participating in this course?

## About course

### This is course for absolute beginners

### No prior knowledge is assumed

### Pace is going to be easy and slow

## Elements of programming

- Introduction to course

- IDE vs Command line

- Different levels of abstractions

- What is abstraction?

- Programming VS coding

- American VS Japanese philosophy

- Built-in functions

- User defined functions

- Collections (list, dictionary, tuple, set)

- Iteration over collection

- For VS while loop

- Exceptions

- Pandas DataFrame()

- Map, Apply, vectorised operations

- Nested collections, nested loops

- Variable scope: global VS local variables

- Mutability

- Classes and Objects

- Abstraction VS implementation

- Procedures

- Types of variables: basic(simple) VS compound(complex)

- Different ways to execute python program

- Programming VS programming language

## Course structure

1. Variables, expressions, statements

2. Functions (builtin and user defined)

3. Control structures - Part I

4. Collections (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)

5. Control structures - Part II

6. Functional programming

7. Exceptions

8. Mutability of objects

9. Classes and objects

10. List comprehension

## Introduction

### 3 family of questions:

1. What are we going to learn? What is the topic? What question do we try to answer?

2. Why is it important? How can it help me? Why do I care? How can I benefit from it? What are its alternatives?

3. How to use it? How to implement it? What are different ways to apply it?

### If someone ask you what is programming, but give you only 10 seconds to answer…

#### Everything is about data

1. Getting data

2. Transforming data

3. Storing data


### Where does name ‘Information technology’ comes from?

### There is relationship: Data -> Information -> Knowledge

- Data - just any number, string or sequence of it

- Information - we know what data means

- Knowledge - we know how to use that information, how to take advantage and why it is important for us

## How computers work

### Computers can do ONLY 3 things:

- Perform calculation

- Remember result

- Decide weather to continue or stop execution

## How humans work

### Feynman technique:

1. Pick and study a topic

2. Explain the topic to someone, like a child, who is unfamiliar to the topic

3. Identify any gaps in your understanding

4. Review and simplify


## Structured approach

### What is structured approach?

### You have clear understanding of:

- Things you want to achieve

- Sequence of steps you need to perform and 

- You can, in simple words, explain your goal and way to achieve it


## Why structured approach?

### Main source of mistake in computer science:

- Things you want to achieve are not understood (you do not know to explain it in simple words)

- Assumptions

- Miscommunication


## Learning strategy

### Looking at things as elements of a whole

- What are important elements?

- What is relationship/hierarchy between elements?

### Take difficult topic and split it apart into sequence of simple steps

### Acceptable number of steps in a sequence

### What does acceptable in this case mean?

- 3-5 cause-effect relationships

### Top to bottom approach

- Start high level

- Go down into implementation details

### Bottom up approach

- Start from (boring) implementation details

- Then, eventually, go to ‘why’ question


## Top down approach

- View from top of the hill VS view from valley.

- Start from top of the hill and slowly go down to valley.

- Valley looks different when observed from top of the hill.

- Top of the hill picture give us broader perspective. 

- Top of the hill = Generalisation.

## Introduction to CS

- In computer science, at the beginning, we don’t know from where to start!

- There is no unique or best way from where to start journey.

-  It is about journey, not final destination!

## Dilemma

- Sometimes there are several ways to do same thing. Easy and hard way.

- Which one to show you first?


## Learning strategy

- It is always good to have final goal in mind!

- How python is going to help me?

- When it is going to help me?

- What are potential use cases where I can apply it?

## Everyone is different

### Person A 

- Figure out concept X in 3 minutes

- Needs 3 hours to figure out concept Y

### Person B

- Figure out concept X in 3 hours

- Needs only 3 minutes to understand concept Y

## Goals

- What are goals of python training?
  - To become good entry level programmer

- What are NOT goals of python training?
  - To make expert from you

## Learning hack

- It is always better to know one thing very good, than to know many things partially.


## Pandas and NumPy

- Pandas is most productive python library.

- This is not training for pandas and numpy.

- Hopefully, after we learn basics, there will be space for new course focused primarily on pandas.

- Pandas and NumPy are special languages built on top of python language.

- They have special syntax.

- Knowledge of python building blocks give us chance to figure out:

  - What can be source of error
  - What is not source of error

- Pandas is very useful and easy to use library. 
  - In order to be easy to use, basic building blocks of python should be mastered first.
- Same story for NumPy.

## Ask question !!!

- What questions are welcomed?
  - Why does it work this way?
  - For me, it is more logical other way around?
  - Why it doesn’t wort that way, but this way?
  - Why someone invented this?
  - How is it going to help me?

- This topic is difficult to master, it will took me lot of time and effort until I become comfortable with it.

- How is it going to help me?

- After I master it, how is it going to improve me as developer?

- What kind of business question I will be able to solve?


## Useful Knowledge

- It is all about generalisation

- Rule 80 / 20

- Important VS Not-important

- Common VS Not-so-common

## Learning = experimentation
