# Controle structures - Part II

## Controle structures

  - Sequence logic, or sequential flow

  - Selection logic, or conditional flow

  - Iteration logic, or repetitive flow (today's focus)


## Two types of loops

  - For loop

  - While loop



## Programming workflow

  - There is raw data

  - Raw data should be processed - Functions

  - Processed data should be stored


## Computers can do 3 things

  - Repeat sth large number of times (today's focus)

  - Remember results

  - Decide when to stop



## Loops

  - Loops are used when we want to execute same part of code multiple times or 
  - When you want to execute same part of code while some condition is true.



## For loop

  - When you know in advance how many iterations you will have


## While loop


  - Used when we do not know how many times some algorithm should be executed.
  - We need to check condition every time, in order to know do we need to stop.
