# Python IDEs
## Where and how to run python program

## Plan for today

  - Installing python 3.7
  - Installing PyCharm IDE
  - Instaling Jupyter notebook
  - Getting familiar with command line
 
 ## Download links
 
  - PyCharm 2020.2
    - https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows

  - Python 3.7 
    - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/
  

## Command line

  - On Mac it is called terminal
  - It is file management system
  - Whatever you can do with your mouse, you can do with command line

  - Every file on PC has path, which uniquely describes it
  - Meaning that using path we can do everything what we can perform using mouse
    - open, close, delete, rename, move
  
## File path
  
  - Root directory
  - Why is directory important?
    - We can open files from current directory by calling just its name
    - We can open file from other directory, but its path should be specified
  - Types of file path:
    - Absolute
    - Relative
  - Absolute file path tells us where particular file is located relative to root directory
  - Relative file path tells us where particular file is located relative to some other directory

  - What is system path?
    - Programs stored in folders that are in system path, can be opened by simply calling their names regardless of folder (file path) we are currently located in !!!

  - All files stored in system pathS must have unique name !!!

## Command line
  - What is necessary to run file on command line?
  - What we need to specify?
    - Using which program we want to open specific file.
    - What specific file we want to open.
  - What activities we can perform on cmd/terminal?
  - What is workflow?
    - Traveling from one place to another (from one folder to another)
    - Opening files from some specific place
    - Renaming, deleting, moving files

## Basic commands on Mac

  - pwd present working directory
  - ls list files from present working directory
  - cd change directory
  - cp copy
  - mv move
  - cd .. go one folder back

## Basic commands on Windows

  - cd present working directory
  - dir list files from present working directory
  - cd change directory
  - copy copy
  - move move
  - cd .. go one folder back


## Command line

  - Be very careful !

  - On command line, you can really make a mess

  - It is just one command from totally destroying PC

  - Example
    - Create txt file on desktop
    - Open it using notepad
    - Type on cmd ‘notepad filepath’
 

## Different ways to run python

  - Command line / terminal

  - Using IDEs

  - Using jupyter


## Terminal/command line

  - Simplest way to run commands
  - Just open terminal and type ‘python’
    - It will work if you included python in system path
  - No support in writing code


## What is good developer?

  - Someone who knows all syntax by heart, or
  - Someone who perfectly knows building blocks and know how to combine different elements into useful and meaningful unit/module.
    - (Some elements of creativity is required).
 

## Modern IDEs

  - An IDE is as important for developer as a calculator for a mathematician.

## Why to use modern IDEs?

  - Autocomplete
  - Documentation
  - Syntax highlight and validation
  - Debugging
  - Refactoring
  - Code generation
  - VCS

## Things I try to avoid

  - Learning syntax by heart
  - Learning over-specific and narrowly specialised functions and methods


## IDE advantages

  - Give us opportunity to focus on important and general things.

  - Provide us with tools to query documentation fast.


  - Release burden of learning language syntax by heart.

  - Give us possibility to choose from!

## PyCharm and Jupiter

  - We are going to use both programs/editors

  - PyCharm is the best product in the market and for most of the tasks it is 5 places in front of its competition

  - Jupyter is becoming more and more popular (PyCharm Professional has Jupyter notebook integrated within IDE)


  - Also, jupyter is good for visualisation and presentations

  - But still, jupyter lacks most of intellisense features



## Python installation

  - Pay attention at ‘include as system variable’. It should be checked.

  - Python should be in system variables.



## PyCharm installation


  - Just follow the steps: ‘next, next…finish’

  - Doesn’t have to be included in system path variables


## Jupiter installation

  - Open command line

  - Type: ‘pip install jupyter’



## PyCharm elements

  - Editor
  - Console
  - Project window
  - Variable explorer


## IDE’s advanced features

  - Quick documentation
  - Function/class implementation details
  - Parameter info
  - Find class/function by name i.e. auto import
  - Debugging
  - Version control

## IDE’s standard features

  - Find and replace
  - Rename
  - Refactor code
  - Syntax highlight
  - Find usage

## PyCharm shortcuts

  - Mac shortcuts
    - Shift + command + I
    - Option + J
    - Command + P
    - Control + space space
    - control+alt+t

  - Windows shortcuts
    - Control + shift + I
    - Control + Q
    - Control + P
    - Control + space space
    - option+command+t

## Jupiter shortcuts

  - command+tab

  - command+tab-tab


## My suggestion

  - Don’t be afraid of making mistakes.

  - Python errors are going to become your second nature.

  - Google is going to be your best friend.


## Other tools available in market

  - VScode
  - Eclipse
  - Visual studio
  - Xcode
  - Jupyter lab

## Extra tip

  - How to see what libraries you have installed?

    - Command: pip list


## Topic for next class

  - Storing data into variables.


## The end

  - Thank you for your most valuable resource, your time.
