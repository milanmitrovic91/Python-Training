# Python IDEs
## Where and how to run python program

## Plan for today

  - Installing python 3.7
  - Installing PyCharm IDE
  - Instaling Jupyter notebook
  - Getting familiar with command line
 
 ## Download links
 
  - PyCharm 2020.2
    - https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows

  - Python 3.7 
    - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/
  

## Command line

  - On Mac it is called terminal
  - It is file management system
  - Whatever you can do with your mouse, you can do with command line

  - Every file on PC has path, which uniquely describes it
  - Meaning that using path we can do everything what we can perform using mouse
    - open, close, delete, rename, move
  
## File path
  
  - Root directory
  - Why is directory important?
    - We can open files from current directory by calling just its name
    - We can open file from other directory, but its path should be specified
  - Types of file path:
    - Absolute
    - Relative
  - Absolute file path tells us where particular file is located relative to root directory
  - Relative file path tells us where particular file is located relative to some other directory

  - What is system path?
    - Programs stored in folders that are in system path, can be opened by simply calling their names regardless of folder (file path) we are currently located in !!!

  - All files stored in system pathS must have unique name !!!

## Command line
  - What is necessary to run file on command line?
  - What we need to specify?
    - Using which program we want to open specific file.
    - What specific file we want to open.
  - What activities we can perform on cmd/terminal?
  - What is workflow?
    - Traveling from one place to another (from one folder to another)
    - Opening files from some specific place
    - Renaming, deleting, moving files

## Basic commands on Mac

  - pwd present working directory
  - ls list files from present working directory
  - cd change directory
  - cp copy
  - mv move
  - cd .. go one folder back

## Basic commands on Windows

  - cd present working directory
  - dir list files from present working directory
  - cd change directory
  - copy copy
  - move move
  - cd .. go one folder back


## Command line

  - Be very careful !

  - On command line, you can really make a mess

  - It is just one command from totally destroying PC

  - Example
    - Create txt file on desktop
    - Open it using notepad
    - Type on cmd ‘notepad filepath’
 

## Different ways to run python
